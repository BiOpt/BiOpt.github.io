<span style="color:grey">Derivatives Calculator</span> 
===
<div style="text-align:justify;">
  It is  known that Matlab provides users a function '<a href="https://uk.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/jacobian.html"> jacobian</a>' to compute the Jacobian matrix of a given single/set-valued function. When it comes to calculate the second order or third order derivatives of a given function, the usage of 'jacobian' seems not to be straightforward and the computations might be quite complicated.

<div style="text-align:justify;">
  Therefore, this toolbox <a href="\files\GetDerivatives.zip">GetDerivatives</a> aims at calculating the first, second and third order derivatives of a single/set-valued function, $f(x):\mathbb{R}^{n_x}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n_f}$, where $n_f\geq1$.   Detailed instructions this toolbox can be found in the <a href="\files\menu-of-BiOpt.pdf">menu-of-BiOpt</a>.
