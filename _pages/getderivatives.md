<span style="color:grey">Derivatives Calculator</span> 
===

It is  known that Matlab provides users a function <span style="color:blue">**jacobian**</span> ([more information here](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/jacobian.html)) to compute the Jacobian
matrix of a given single/set-valued function. When it comes to calculate the second order or third order derivatives of a given function, the usage of <span style="color:blue">**jacobian**</span> seems not to be straightforward and the computations might be quite complicated.  

Therefore, this toolbox <span style="color:blue">**GetDerivatives**</span> ([GetDerivatives.zip](\files\GetDerivatives.zip)) aims at calculating the first, second and third order derivatives of a single/set-valued function, $f(x):\mathbb{R}^{n_x}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n_f}$, where $n_f\geq1$.   Detailed instructions this toolbox can be found in the [menu-of-BiOpt.pdf](\files\menu-of-BiOpt.pdf).
