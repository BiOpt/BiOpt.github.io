It is well known that Matlab provides users a function $\texttt{jacobian}$ to compute the Jacobian
matrix of a given single/set-valued function. When it comes to calculate the second order
or third order derivatives of the given function, the usage of $\texttt{jacobian}$ seems not to be
straightforward and thus the computations are quite complicated.  

Therefore, this toolbox [$\texttt{GetDerivatives}$](\files\GetDerivatives.zip) aims to calculate the first, second and third order derivatives of 
a single/set-valued function, $f(x):\mathbb{R}^{n_x}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n_f}$.   Detailed descriptions of usage of this toolbox can be found in  the [menu](\files\menu-of-BiOpt.pdf). 
$\texttt{GetDerivatives}$ can be [download here](\files\GetDerivatives.zip).
