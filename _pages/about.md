<span style="color:grey">Welcome to BiOpt Toolbox</span> 
===

<div style="text-align:justify;"> <span style="color:blue"> <b> BiOpt toolbox </b> </span>, to help accelerate the development of numerical toolboxes for  <a href="https://biopt.github.io/solvers/">bilevel optimization</a>,   aims at providing a platform on which users can test a wide range of bilevel optimization problems by using the provided solvers. The whole <a href="\files\BiOpt-toolbox.zip">BiOpt-toolbox.zip</a> is created through Matlab. To well understand how to use it, please see a <a href="\files\menu-of-BiOpt.pdf">menu-of-BiOpt.pdf</a>.  The current version of toolbox is made up of four basic tools: </div>

<div style="text-align:justify;">[BiOpt-Solvers.zip](\files\BiOpt-Solvers.zip) contains three bilevel optimization solvers: <span style="color:blue">**SNLLVF**</span>, <span style="color:blue">**SNQVI**</span>  and <span style="color:blue">**SNKKT**</span>. All of them are created based on Semismooth Newton-type methods.  [More information here](https://biopt.github.io/solvers/) 

<span style="color:grey">BOLIB </span>

<span style="color:grey">Derivatives calculator </span>  
---
<div style="text-align:justify;">[GetDerivatives.zip](\files\GetDerivatives.zip) provides a tool to calculate the first, second and third order derivatives of a single/set-valued function. [More information here](https://biopt.github.io/getderivatives/) 
</div>

<span style="color:grey">Optimal-value function tools </span>   
---
<div style="text-align:justify;">[OptValFunc.zip](\files\OptValFunc.zip) comprises two tools to operate an optimal-value function with plotting  its graph or computing its function value.  [More information here](https://biopt.github.io/valuefunc/)
