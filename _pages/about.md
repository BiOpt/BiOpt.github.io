To help accelerate the development of numerical toolboxes for bilevel optimization, BiOpt aims at providing:

* a tool to calculate the first, second and third order derivatives
of a single/set-valued function.

* a tool to plot the graph of an optimal-value function in the form of  $\psi(x) = min_y {f(x, y):g(x; y)\ leq 0}$ and a tool to calculate the function value

* BOLIB,  a collection of academic and real-world applications or case studies on the problem including 24 linear, 138 nonlinear and 11 simple bilevel optimization test examples 

* three bilevel optimization solvers
