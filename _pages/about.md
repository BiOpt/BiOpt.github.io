To help accelerate the development of numerical toolboxes for bilevel optimization, the toolbox aims at creating a platform on which users can test a wide range of bilevel optimization problems by using the provided solvers. The whole $\texttt{BiOpt}$ toolbox can be  download here [BiOpt-toolbox.zip](\files\BiOpt-toolbox.zip). To well understand how to use it, please see a [menu-of-BiOpt.pdf](\files\menu-of-BiOpt.pdf).  $\texttt{BiOpt}$ currently comprises four basic tools:

Bilevel optimization solvers 
---
[BiOpt-Solvers.zip](\files\BiOpt-Solvers.zip) contains three bilevel optimization solvers: $\texttt{SNLLVF}$, $\texttt{SNQVI}$ and $\texttt{SNKKT}$. All of them are created based on Semismooth Newton-type methods.  [More information here](https://biopt.github.io/solvers/) 

Derivatives calculator 
---
[GetDerivatives.zip](\files\GetDerivatives.zip) provides a tool to calculate the first, second and third order derivatives of a single/set-valued function. [More information here](https://biopt.github.io/getderivatives/) 

Optimal-value function tools 
---
[OptValFunc.zip](\files\OptValFunc.zip) provides two tools to operate an optimal-value function with plotting  its graph or computing its function value.  [More information here](https://biopt.github.io/valuefunc/) 

BOLIBver2 
---
[BOLIBver2.zip](\files\BOLIBver2.zip) is a collection of academic and real-world applications or case studies on the problems including 24 linear, 138 nonlinear and 11 simple bilevel optimization test examples. [More information here](https://biopt.github.io/bolib/)
