<span style="color:orange">Welcome to BiOpt Toolbox</span>
=== 
To help accelerate the development of numerical toolboxes for bilevel optimization, the toolbox aims at creating a platform on which users can test a wide range of bilevel optimization problems by using the provided solvers. The whole <span style="color:grey">**BiOpt**</span> toolbox can be  download here [BiOpt-toolbox.zip](\files\BiOpt-toolbox.zip). To well understand how to use it, please see a [menu-of-BiOpt.pdf](\files\menu-of-BiOpt.pdf).  <span style="color:blue">**BiOpt**</span> currently comprises four basic tools:

<span style="color:green">Bilevel optimization solvers </span>

[BiOpt-Solvers.zip](\files\BiOpt-Solvers.zip) contains three bilevel optimization solvers: <span style="color:grey">**SNLLVF**</span>, <span style="color:grey">**SNQVI**</span>  and <span style="color:grey">**SNKKT**</span>. All of them are created based on Semismooth Newton-type methods.  [More information here](https://biopt.github.io/solvers/) 

<span style="color:green">Derivatives calculator </span>  
---
[GetDerivatives.zip](\files\GetDerivatives.zip) provides a tool to calculate the first, second and third order derivatives of a single/set-valued function. [More information here](https://biopt.github.io/getderivatives/) 

<span style="color:green">Optimal-value function tools </span>   
---
[OptValFunc.zip](\files\OptValFunc.zip) provides two tools to operate an optimal-value function with plotting  its graph or computing its function value.  [More information here](https://biopt.github.io/valuefunc/) 

<span style="color:green">BOLIB </span>

[BOLIBver2.zip](\files\BOLIBver2.zip) is a collection of academic and real-world applications or case studies on the problems including 24 linear, 138 nonlinear and 11 simple bilevel optimization test examples. [More information here](https://biopt.github.io/bolib/)
