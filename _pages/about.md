To help accelerate the development of numerical toolboxes for bilevel optimization, BiOpt aims at creating a platform on which users can test a wide range of bilevel optimization problems by using the provided solvers. BiOpt toolbox currently comprises four basic aspects:

Bilevel optimization solvers
---
There are three bilevel optimization solvers: SNLLVF, SNQVI and SNKKT. All of them are created based on Semismooth Newton-type methods.  [More information here](https://biopt.github.io/solvers/) or [download](\files\BiOpt-Solvers.zip)

Derivatives calculator
---
This is a tool to calculate the first, second and third order derivatives of a single/set-valued function. [More information here](https://biopt.github.io/getderivatives/) or [download](\files\GetDerivatives.zip)

Optimal-value function tools
---
There are two tools to operate an optimal-value function in the form of  $\psi(x) = \min_{y} \{f(x, y):~g(x; y)\leq 0\}$, with plotting  its graph or computing its function value. [More information here](https://biopt.github.io/valuefunc/) or [download](\files\OptValFunc.zip)

BOLIB
---
A collection of academic and real-world applications or case studies on the problem including 24 linear, 138 nonlinear and 11 simple bilevel optimization test examples. [More information here](https://biopt.github.io/bolib/) or [download](\files\BOLIBExamples.zip)
