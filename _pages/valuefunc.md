This toolbox aims to operate an optimal-value function (OVF) in the form 

$$\psi(x) = \min_{y} \{f(x, y):~g(x; y)\leq 0\}$$.

The toolbox [OptValFunc](\files\OptValFunc.zip) comrises two tools. PlotOVF  plots  the graph $\psi(x)$ along with $x$. 
SolOVF solves the above minimization problem with providing the function values and corresponding optimal solutions.
