This bilevel optimization test problems libary is constraucted from the old version of $\texttt{BOLIB}$
([more information here](https://github.com/ShenglongZhou/BOLIB) ). 
The old version contains 124 nonlinear bilevel optimization test
examples (see [details here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325120369) ). 

This new version of $\texttt{BOLIB}$  comprisesa 138 nonlinear, 24 linear and  11 Simple bilevel optimization test examples. One can
refer [BOLIB2019_test_examples_library_version2](\files\BOLIB2019_test_examples_library_version2.pdf) for more detailed information, such as the dimensions, best known optimal upper and lower-level objective function
values, or the starting points. All examples are coded through Matlab and saved in m-files.
